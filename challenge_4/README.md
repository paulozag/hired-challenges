<h2>Challenge 4: Deviation</h2>

Given an array of integer elements, and an ineger d, please consider all the sequences of d consecutive elements in the array.  For each sequence we compute the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the elements in that sequence and name it the deviation.

**Your task is to**
<ul>
    <li>write a function that finds the maximym value among the deviations of all the sequences considered above</li>
    
    <li>print the result to the standard output</li>
</ul>

Note that your function will receive the following arguments
<ul>
    <li> **v** - an array of inntegers</li>
    <li> ** d ** - an integer value giving the length of the sequences</li>
</ul>

**Data constraints**
<ul>
    <li>the array eill contain up to 100,000 elements.</li>
    <li>all the elements in the array are integer numbers in the following ranfe: [1, 2^31 -1]</li>
    <li>the value of d will not exceed the length of the given array.</li>
</ul>

**Efficiency constraints**
<ul>
    <li>your function is expected to print the result in less than 2 seconds</li>
</ul>
